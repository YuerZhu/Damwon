Project: Image Encryption and Decryption

Introduction:

Our project is to program a way to encrypt and decrypt images in Rust. 

Our goal would be to make it so that a user is able to submit an image to be encrypted, or to send in an encrypted image to be decrypted, outputting the original image. We chose this project because it would be an interesting introduction to the idea of encryption on computers, despite our own program not being as sophisticated as existing encryptors. We hope that this project will help provide us with a deeper understanding of the process of encryption as well. Furthermore, this project could be a cool way for people to send “secret” encrypted images to one another and be able to decrypt it.
